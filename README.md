# networking-ts-impl

An implementation of the C++ Networking Technical Specification.

Warning: This implementation is automatically generated from the
[Asio](https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/asio) library. Consequently, it may
still be missing small pieces of functionality, or contain artifacts from Asio
that are not part of the TS.

## Supported platforms and compilers

Requires C++11 or later. Should work with:
* Recent gcc or clang on Linux, macOS and other similar POSIX platforms.
* Recent versions of Microsoft Visual Studio on Windows.

## Scope

A testsuite, examples and documentation are considered out-of-scope for this
repository, as these should be independent of a particular TS implementation.
However, some generated reference documentation can be found here:
